# CP-Lib: Benchmark Instances of the Clique Partitioning Problem
by Michael M. Sørensen, Aarhus University & Adam N. Letchford, Lancaster University

The file "Clique_Partitioning_Library.pdf" contains information about the problem instances in terms of data sources, partition values, and computational difficulty (with a branch-and-cut based CPP solver).
The final revised version of the article has been published in Mathematical Programming Computation: M.M. Sørensen & A.N. Letchford (2024) CP-Lib: Benchmark instances of the clique partitioning problem, Math. Program. Comput., 16, 93--111. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12532-023-00249-1.
