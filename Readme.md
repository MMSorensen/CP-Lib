# CP-Lib: Benchmark Instances of the Clique Partitioning Problem
by Michael M. Sørensen, Aarhus University & Adam N. Letchford, Lancaster University

The file "Clique_Partitioning_Library.pdf" contains information about the problem instances in terms of data sources, partition values, and computational difficulty (with a branch-and-cut based CPP solver).
The article (in revised form) has been accepted for publication in Mathematical Programming Computation. The final version is available (via subscription) here: https://doi.org/10.1007/s12532-023-00249-1.
